What's up! I teach Calculus, Power Systems Engineering, and Research Methods at Western Mindanao State University. My goal is to empower our graduate students with critical thinking skills and a good attitude. Additionally, execute responsible research and data analysis on any output, especially those that involve electrical circuits. 

*<h3 align="center">I am also a believer of self-learning and collaboration. </h3>*
 
*<h2 align="center">I looooove time series data, its properties, transformations, and models.</h2>*
