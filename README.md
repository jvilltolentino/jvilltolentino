What's up! I teach Calculus, Power Systems Engineering, and Research Methods at Western Mindanao State University. My goal is to empower our undergraduate students with critical thinking skills and a good attitude. Additionally, execute responsible research and data analysis on any output, especially those that involve electrical circuits.
